def exc1_three_in_one():
    """Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.
    Idea:
            First we should think about how to implement a single stack with a single array, then expand to three.
            Single: Basically I'd chose an array size and have a index to the last element which is not None. Elements
            are being added to the back of the array by setting the value at position last + 1 and removed by un-setting
            element last. Those are O(1) operations. When the stack is full and an element is being added, double
            the size of the underlying array by creating a new array and copying things over.

            Triple: For having three stacks implemented, we need to subdivide the array into three compartments, each
            of which holds the data for a single stack. The subdivision in terms of index ranges looks as follows.
            s1 = [0, n/3)
            s2 = [n/3, 2n/3)
            s3 = [2n/3, n]
            One issue is the stacks could be very unbalanced, leading to early new space requirements even though
            most of the space is unused. Also the actual increase of space is more complicated since we have to track
            all sub arrays.

    """Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
    Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some
    threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be
    composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
    SetOfStacks. push() and SetOfStacks. pop() should behave identically to a single stack
    (that is, pop () should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).

    Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific subÂ­
    stack."""
