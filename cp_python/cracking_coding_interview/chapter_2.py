    "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

    Idea1:
        We could have two new linked lists, one for elements smaller to pivot (element which determines partition)
        and one for elements bigger or equal to pivot. Then, we concatenate them by setting the head of the
        second list as next of last of the first list.

        If all we need to do is have a pivot where the elements go on either side depending on their value but no
        order preservation is required, we can initialize an empty list and prepend / append elements from the
        original list.
